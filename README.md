## Various scripts/tools that I've cobbled together over the years

*  `analyse-edid` - Decode the EDID data (Extended Display Identification Data)
*  `screen-at` - Wrapper around `ssh` + `screen`
*  `ds200/` - An init-script for a named pipe and a listener script that parses the incoming syslog data from a DS200 (a spam filtering appliance from Deep Six Technologies, now long gone)
*  `Wordpress/` - Contains a single custom widget that I wrote at some point
