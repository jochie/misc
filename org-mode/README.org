#+STARTUP: indent
* =confluence_upload.sh=
This has been created (and tested on) the Atlassian Confluence Server only, not the Atlassian cloud variation.

The scripts expect to find a =~/.confluence.config= file that it sources. It should look like this:
#+begin_src text
CONF_USER="username"
CONF_SPACE="space-key"
CONF_PARENT="Your Parent Page"
CONF_SERVER="https://confluence.example.com"
CONF_ELISP="~/.emacs"
#+end_src

The =CONF_SPACE= and =CONF_PARENT= are default values, in case nothing is specified in the org-mode file itself, like this:
#+begin_src text
#+confluence-space: space-key
#+confluence-parent: My Parent Page
#+confluence-title: Title Of The Page
#+end_src

The =CONF_ELISP= can point to a non-standard minimal startup file that is just enough to make sure that =org-confluence-export-as-confluence= is available to run, because the =emacs --batch= environment is very minimal, though I just point it to =~/.emacs= myself, at this time.
